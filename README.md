z0r-mirror
==========

Tools to make your own local mirror of all the flash clips at z0r.de and keep them up-to-date. Totally worth it.

### Wait what?
http://www.z0r.de/ is a site where flash loops are collected. It's pointless, it's absurd, it's awesome.

### Why the hell?
I'm doing a z0r-marathon with friends. And if you want to click through a lot (currently 4880) flash clips in a reasonable amount of time, you want them to load fast. So I mirrored them locally and built a small html page that loads them in an iframe.
I also build a GTK GUI that shows the clips (using webkit). That GUI can be controlled via keyboard (arrow keys) or telnet or the remote control GUI.

### SRSLY?
I did this project in three steps:
* have a stupid idea
* do it anyways
* massively overdo it
